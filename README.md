to do:
- fix landing page after container refactor
- variable BottomNav for project showcases
	- next, prev, etc.
- replace images with GIFs on Explore pages
- horizontal screen lock on mobile for Project Gallery
- sometimes hitting 'next'/'prev' renders a page that's
	halfway scrolled down 
		- appears to not be re-rendering completely
			- (animation doesn't occur?)
