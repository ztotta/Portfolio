						  			   the 6 instruments and calls a setTimeout on each. 
						  			   Once they all resolve, it cycles through again and calls 'playStep'   			 for each instrument, triggering the correct note for the 
						  			   step at the current iteration (wherever 'i' is in the count), granted the instrument is unmuted. Meanwhile, the next step's 
						  			   Promise.all is underway, granted the loop is still toggled 'On'. See code snippet below:" />
